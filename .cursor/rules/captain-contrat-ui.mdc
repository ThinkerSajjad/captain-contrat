// LAYOUT STRUCTURE
- Root layout follows an 85% width constraint on large screens (lg breakpoint and above)
- Full width on small screens (below lg breakpoint)
- Apply "w-full mx-auto lg:w-[85%]" to main content containers
- Header spans the full width with inner content respecting the 85% constraint
- All dropdowns take full screen width with inner content matching the 85% constraint

// HEADER & NAVIGATION
- Header is sticky with a white background and subtle bottom border
- Logo positioned on the left, navigation in the center, utility icons on the right
- Dropdown menus triggered by click (not hover) with toggle functionality
- All dropdowns close when clicking outside the menu area
- Use transform/opacity transitions for smooth dropdown animations

// DROPDOWN MENU IMPLEMENTATION
- Use state management in HeaderMenu with click event handlers
- Implement click-outside detection with useEffect and ref
- Toggle active dropdown by clicking the same menu item
- For dropdown menu items, use button elements with onClick handlers
- For regular navigation items, maintain link behavior with Link component
- Add visual indicators (arrow icon) for dropdown menus
- Animate dropdowns with translate and opacity transitions

// RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- Menu layout is fully responsive with appropriate spacing on mobile
- On small screens, maintain full width content
- On large screens (lg breakpoint and above), constrain content to 85% width
- Maintain dropdown functionality consistently across breakpoints

// ACCESSIBILITY
- Use proper ARIA attributes for menu components (aria-expanded, aria-haspopup)
- Implement keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space to toggle dropdowns)
- Maintain focus management within dropdown menus
- Include semantic roles (role="menu", aria-orientation="vertical")
- Add aria-hidden="true" for decorative icons

// MENU STYLING STANDARDS
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling
- Consistent color scheme with blue-600 for active/hover states
- Subtle transitions for interactive elements (hover, active states)
- Dropdown menus have white background with subtle shadow
- Use column grid layout for organizing dropdown content sections
- Include visual indicators that rotate on dropdown state change
