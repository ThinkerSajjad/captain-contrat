        <h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-tertiary mb-6">What are the mandatory registers for the SASU?</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-4">You want to create a <strong>single-member simplified joint-stock company</strong> - a SASU. The creation and operation of this type of company means compliance with certain mandatory formalities.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">A SASU is a simplified version of an SAS (Simplified Joint Stock Company). It's a flexible legal status with many advantages. By becoming the sole shareholder of a SASU (limited joint-stock company), you have the opportunity to be both an employee and a president. This will give you complete freedom to manage your business as you wish.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">However, even if you are the sole manager of your SASU, the law requires you to keep certain records. In this article, Captain Contrat explains which records you must keep and the penalties you face if you fail to comply.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">Certain registers are common to all forms of company. However, there are <strong>mandatory registers for a SASU</strong>. These legal registers must be kept within the framework of a SASU:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
          <li>the register of beneficial owners;</li>
          <li>the register of the movements;</li>
          <li>the register of decisions of the sole shareholder.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section id="register-beneficial-owners" class="scroll-mt-24 mt-12">
        <h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-tertiary mb-4">The register of beneficial owners</h3>
        
        <p class="mb-4">Since the Sapin II law of August 2, 2017, it is mandatory to keep the register of beneficial owners. This obligation applies to all forms of company, regardless of effective control of a company. It consists of identifying all natural persons who exercise effective control of the company.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">This registration must be made by persons holding more than 25% of the voting rights or capital of a company.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">In a SASU, there is a single partner who can also act as president of the SASU. This partner therefore holds 100% of the company's capital. However, the obligation to keep a register of beneficial owners applies to the SASU.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The register of beneficial owners must be filed with the commercial court. The information to be filled in is that at the time of creation of the SASU, either by mail or online. The register must include:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
          <li>information about the company: its date of creation, its registered office, the amount of share capital, its corporate name, its identification number;</li>
          <li>information regarding the active beneficiaries: for the SASU, this refers to the sole shareholder, or president.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-tertiary mb-4">The register of securities movements</h3>
        
        <p class="mb-4">A SASU must keep a <strong>register of securities movements</strong>. This register records all transactions that affect the shares in the SASU's share capital, such as transfers of shares and contributions of shares.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The register must include:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
          <li>the nature of the operation carried out by the transaction;</li>
          <li>the date of the operation;</li>
          <li>the identity of the new and former holder of the SASU shares;</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-tertiary mb-4">The register of decisions of the sole shareholder</h3>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The SASU is composed of a <strong>single partner</strong> who alone makes decisions relating to the company. Organizing and holding a general meeting is therefore not necessary.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The sole partner of the SASU must only record in a register of decisions all decisions affecting the company. These decisions may concern:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
          <li>the modification of the SASU statutes;</li>
          <li>the approval of the annual accounts;</li>
          <li>the dissolution of SASU;</li>
          <li>the liquidation of the SASU.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-6">Each deliberation of the sole shareholder is transcribed in a decision report, which is itself recorded in this register of decisions of the sole shareholder. This is a binder containing sheets which are numbered and initialed by the order of the commercial court or by the mayor of the municipality where the SASU is located.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">In parallel with these legal registers, the sole shareholder must keep accounting registers:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>The journal</strong>: records all transactions that have an impact on the SASU's assets. This includes all of the SASU's accounting entries.</li>
          <li><strong>The ledger</strong>: records the same movements, but classifies the information from the accounting plan established by the SASU.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-6">However, the employment register is only required if the SASU has employees. This register is mandatory as soon as the SASU hires an employee. Sometimes, it must also keep a register of weekly rest periods, when the activity of the SASU requires it (in particular when employees work on Sundays).</p>

                Depending on your business activity, you may be required to keep specific records. For example, if your SASU operates in the construction industry, you must keep a construction site register that all documents relating to the progress of the construction site.

        <p class="mb-4">The SASU is exposed to risks if one of these mandatory registers is not kept.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">In the absence of declaration of a <strong>register of beneficial owners</strong>, or if the information in the register is incomplete, the sole shareholder may be sentenced to a 6 months of imprisonment and a fine of ‚Ç¨7,500.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">If the sole shareholder of the SASU does not keep a <strong>register of securities movements</strong>, this does not necessarily expose him to sanctions. On the other hand, as each movement of shares must be transcribed, in absence, this can be challenged by any interested party.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">If the sole shareholder of the SASU does not keep the <strong>register of decisions</strong>, this does not expose him to legal sanctions. On the other hand, any person having knowledge of a decision not recorded in a register may request its recording. In the event of refusal by the sole shareholder, the court may order it. The return to comply with the obligation to keep this register may be considered an embarrassment on the part of the sole shareholder - this may may thus be personally liable.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">With regard to accounting obligations, any missing, inaccurate or fictitious entry exposes the person responsible to a fine of up to ‚Ç¨9,000 and a prison sentence of five years.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">A Simplified Joint-Stock Company (SAS) is a flexible form of commercial company that was created in 1994 to encourage entrepreneurship in France. It has become one of the most popular legal structures for businesses due to its contractual freedom and limited liability.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The SAS is characterized by great freedom in terms of organization and operation. It requires a minimum capital of 1 euro and can be constituted with a single shareholder (in which case it becomes a SASU - Simplified Joint-Stock Company with a Single Shareholder).</p>

        <p class="mb-4">A capital reduction is an operation that consists of reducing the amount of a company's share capital. This can be done in several ways: by reducing the nominal value of shares, by reducing the number of shares, or by repurchasing shares by the company itself.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">Capital reduction can be motivated by various reasons: offsetting losses, returning excess capital to shareholders, or restructuring the company's finances.</p>
