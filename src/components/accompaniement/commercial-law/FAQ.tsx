      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Why hire a <strong>commercial lawyer</strong>? Maintaining business
          relationships and developing a professional and commercial activity
          requires respect for and understanding of applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you sell products that you purchase, you will need to
          enter into a distribution agreement. Distribution law is a branch of
          commercial law. Your lawyer will advise you on the most appropriate
          and protective clauses in your situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In France, <strong>commercial law</strong> is constantly evolving. It
          is therefore essential to stay up-to-date with the latest laws and
          regulations in this area. Consulting an expert lawyer is a good way to
          obtain quality and comprehensive information.

    question: "What is a commercial lawyer?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          A commercial lawyer is the primary contact in a business. They are
          most often involved during the course of your business and are
          interested in all the <strong>commercial relationships</strong> you
          may have established (contracts, commercial leases, credits, etc.).
          Using such a lawyer allows you to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Create a legal framework for your business relationships</li>
          <li>Protect yourself from unforeseen market events</li>
          <li>
            Be represented in court and defend your interests in the event of
            prosecution
          </li>
          <li>
            Engaging the civil/commercial liability of your partners (supplier,
            bank, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the event of <strong>disputes with a business partner</strong>{" "}
          (litigation), he will most often be called upon to represent your
          interests before the commercial court or before the district court (if
          the liability involved is of a civil nature) but upstream, the lawyer
          allows you to negotiate with the opposing party and very often to
          reach an agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          To practice his profession, the commercial lawyer relies on the
          various provisions of the <strong>Commercial Code</strong>, but also
          of the <strong>Civil Code</strong> (law of obligations) and remains up
          to date with legal news and the constant evolution of the legal
          context of commerce.

            The Macron law of August 6, 2015 simplified the administrative

    question: "What is a competition law attorney?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Competition law encompasses all legal rules aimed at ensuring the
          maintenance of fair competition between economic actors or sanctioning
          obstacles they bring, intentionally or not, to the free play of the
          economic market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although competition law is a branch of business law, it touches on
          other legal disciplines such as European Union law, contract law,
          economic law, etc. The application of competition law is ensured in
          France by an independent administrative authority, the Competition
          Authority, and by the judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The competition law attorney</strong> is essential to help you
          comply with regulations or to defend you in the context of a dispute.

    question: "What is an unfair competition lawyer?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          <strong>The unfair competition lawyer</strong> is a competition law
          attorney specialized in the field of unfair competition and therefore
          abusive commercial practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have followed general business law training, then specialized in
          unfair competition law along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfair competition law is a branch of competition law and therefore
          depends on business law. It is the set of legal rules aimed at
          sanctioning abusive commercial practices implemented between
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other competition infractions (abuse of dominant position,
          illegal agreement, etc.), unfair competition is sanctioned by the
          Civil Code on the basis of extracontractual liability. There are 4
          abusive commercial practices: denigration, imitation, disorganization
          and parasitism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main mission of <strong>the unfair competition lawyer</strong> is
          to avoid the implementation of abusive commercial practices within
          your company. Concretely, they ensure that no competitive process used
          within your company can cause harm to your competitors.

          Each lawyer freely sets their fees. The criteria used to set fees are
          the complexity of the case, the time spent on the case, the

          hourly rate is between â‚¬180-250 excluding tax.

          Furthermore, as part of their support, the sales team discusses with

          progress of the case step by step. They are the intermediary between
          you and our network of lawyers. This is why the total price also
