    question: "What is a service provision contract?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The service provision contract is defined in article 1710 of the Civil
          Code.
        </p>

        <p>Through this agreement:</p>
        <div>
          <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              a service provider undertakes to carry out work independently and
              without representing the client;
            </li>

            <li>a customer agrees to pay for the service.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          The contract sets out the scope and duration of the service, the
          amount of compensation, and all terms and conditions necessary for its
          delivery. Once signed, it has legal force. Each party must fulfill its
          obligations.

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The activities that can be the subject of a service provision are very
          varied. They concern different sectors:
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>the rental of means of transport;</li>
          <li>advice (legal, accounting, real estate);</li>

          <li>IT and new web professions such as editor or web developer;</li>
          <li>personal assistance and service;</li>
          <li>logistics, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between an employment contract and a service contract? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The service provision contract is carried out in complete
          independence, that is to say that there is no relationship of
          subordination between the parties . Thus, it should not be assimilated
          to an employment contract.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also important to be vigilant when drafting the service
          provision contract to avoid reclassification as an undeclared
          employment contract. Indeed, there may be consequences for the social
          security system, and more specifically for the payment of social
          security contributions.

  {
    question: "Sales contract or service contract: whatâ€™s the difference? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-5">
        <p>
          The contract for the sale of goods (as opposed to contracts for the
          provision of services) does not concern the performance of a service,
          but the sale of a thing:
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>real estate and personal property;</li>
          <li>tangible or intangible property.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The sales contract therefore implies an obligation to give a good.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, a service contract may be mixed if it involves the
          performance and delivery of a thing. Obligations and guarantees differ
          depending on the classification of the contract.

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4 ">
        <p>
          The service provision contract is a synallagmatic contract , that is
          to say that it imposes obligations on both parties.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold ">Obligations of the service provider</p>
        <p>
          The service provider is required to comply with certain obligations,
          including:
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            the obligation to do: the service must be performed as defined in
            the contract;
          </li>
          <li>
            the obligation to provide information: this includes the duty to
            provide information, the duty to warn, and the duty to advise. The
            service provider undertakes to find out what the client really
            wants, to warn the client about any potential risks and problems
            that the service may cause, and to guide the client in their
            choices.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="font-bold">Customer's obligations</p>
        <p>
          Conversely, the customer must respect his obligations towards the
          service provider. In particular, he is required to:
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            pay the price of the service: failing this, the service provider is
            entitled to suspend the performance of the services or to demand the
            return of services already provided;
          </li>
          <li>
            provide the service provider with all the means necessary to carry
            out the service.

          When a service contract is intended for non-professionals, it is

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Article L. 131-1 of the Consumer Code specifies the sanctions if the
          professional breaches his obligation to provide information

        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">

          provide information on these elements is liable to an administrative

          person and 15,000 euros for a legal entity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Article L. 131-1-1 of the Consumer Code adds that any failure to
          comply with a pre-contractual obligation to provide information
          relating to the existence and terms of implementation of legal
          guarantees (legal guarantee against hidden defects or commercial
          guarantees) is punishable by an administrative fine, the amount of
          which may not exceed 15,000 euros for a natural person and 75,000
          euros for a legal entity.

  //   How to terminate a service contract?

  // To understand the terms of termination or breach of a service provision contract , it is necessary to distinguish between two hypotheses:

  // Fixed-term service contract : In principle, it cannot be terminated before the end of the term. However, if the client and the service provider agree, it is possible to terminate the contract. Likewise, if the client fails to fulfill one of its obligations, unilateral termination may be considered.
  // the indefinite-term service provision contract :
  // there is an early termination clause: it will be necessary to refer to it to determine the terms of termination of the contract;
  // There is no early termination clause: the service provider must inform the client of its intention to terminate the contract, respecting a reasonable notice period. If the service relationship is terminated abruptly, the service provider may be ordered to pay compensation or damages to the client.
