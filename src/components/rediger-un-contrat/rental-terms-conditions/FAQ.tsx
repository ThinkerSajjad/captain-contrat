        <p>
          Rental terms and conditions are the legal information that a product
          or service provider makes available to its customers, particularly to
          better regulate relationships related to the rental of its products or
          services. They must appear on all commercial websites. However, they
          may also appear in any rental contract signed between individuals or
          professionals.

  {
    question: "General rental conditions: what are they for? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The general rental conditions reflect the company's business policy
          and, more generally, define the responsibilities of the parties
          involved in the rental in questionâ€”that is, the lessor and the lessee.
          In other words, they represent the advantage of limiting the risk of
          subsequent disputes between the parties to the contract by delineating
          the conditions relating to the rental of the property in question.
        </p>

        <p>
          If, for example, it is a vehicle, the general rental conditions will
          define the proper use of the rented vehicle, the driver's insurance
          terms, the conditions that the driver must meet in order to be able to
          rent the vehicle, etc.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What is the content of these conditions? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The content of the general rental conditions can be quite extensive
          and, moreover, varies depending on the property covered by the rental
          agreement. Indeed, it could be a rental agreement for an apartment, a
          vehicle, premises, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that, in general, these conditions define the proper use of the
          rented property and the conditions that the tenant must meet in order
          to rent it. In addition, they have the advantage of pre-regulating any
          potential disputes, for example, the charges applied to the tenant of
          a vehicle in the event of a claim, or, similarly, those applied to the
          tenant of an apartment.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Who will the general rental conditions apply to? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The general rental conditions apply, by default, to the parties to the
          contract (for example, the vehicle rental company and the lessee).
          These parties will therefore be obliged to comply with the conditions
          they set for themselves beforehand, when signing the rental contract.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, in some cases it is also possible that the general rental
          conditions apply to third parties, in particular when additional
          contracts relating to the rental have been signed (for example, a
          maintenance contract for cars that a company rents to its customers).

    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I use the rental terms and conditions of one of my competitors? ",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Copying a competitor's rental terms and conditions is prohibited by
          law .
        </p>

        <p>
          Indeed, even if it is perfectly normal for there to be common points
          between the general rental conditions of different companies, it is
          however essential that you personalize yours according to the activity
          you carry out.
        </p>

        <p>In other words, your conditions must be tailor-made .</p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, you risk being sued and having to pay damages to your
          competitors, not to mention the negative effects that legal action
          could have on your company's reputation.
