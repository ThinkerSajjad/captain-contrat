        <p>
          Online tools allow you to save valuable time. No more paperwork: scan
          your invoices and they'll automatically be linked to the corresponding
          expense.

    question: "Do I have to have an accountant?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          You are not required to be accompanied by a chartered accountant.
          However, if you do not take a chartered accountant, you will have to
          carry out all the obligations listed above alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking a chartered accountant can therefore save you time. Chartered
          accountants can also give you valuable advice to help you make the
          right financial decisions and optimize your taxation. Furthermore,
          having a chartered accountant reduces the risks of undergoing a tax
          audit.

          Depending on your tax regime, you must regularly declare and pay VAT,
          corporate tax or income tax. Social declarations must also be made,

          Throughout the year, you must keep up to date a journal and a general
          ledger. These documents allow you to precisely track all the financial
          operations of your company. Each transaction must be justified and

          Yes, at the end of each fiscal year, companies must file their annual
          accounts (balance sheet, income statement and annexes) with the
          commercial court registry. In case of forgetting or delay, a fine of

          file the accounts with the registry.
