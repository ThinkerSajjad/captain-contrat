    question: "ðŸ“Œ  Why use an online accounting firm?",
    answer: "Online tools save you valuable time. No more paperwork: scan your invoices and they'll automatically be linked to the corresponding expense. \n These tools also save your accountant time, allowing us to offer more competitive rates than a traditional firm. \n And even though it's an online accounting firm, you can meet your accountant in person. We know that physical contact can be important at certain stages of a business's life. Therefore, we can arrange a meeting with your accountant at our offices so you can talk face-to-face if you prefer. Our accounting firm may be online, but we're still available for our clients!"
