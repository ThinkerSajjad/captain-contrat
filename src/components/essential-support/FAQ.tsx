    question: "What is account approval?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Every company must approve its accounts. The company's directors must
          submit the company's accounts for approval to the partners (for SARLs
          and SCIs) or shareholders (for SASs).
        </p>
        <p>The annual accounts are:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            The balance sheet (assets and liabilities of the company which shows
            the financial situation of a company)
          </li>
          <li>The income statement (the company's income and expenses)</li>
          <li>
            The annexes (documents allowing a better understanding of the two
            previous ones)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An ordinary general meeting must therefore be held within six months
          of the end of the financial year. This meeting must then approve or
          disapprove the accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, companies' activities end on December 31. Therefore, the
          accounts must be approved no later than June 30 of the following year.
          However, it is possible to submit a justified request to the president
          of the commercial court to waive the six-month deadline, even if the
          meeting has already been convened (as long as it has not been held).
          If the accounts have been approved, they must be filed with the
          registry of the commercial court.

    question: "What is the difference between a lawyer and a jurist?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Every project leader often wonders whether they should call on a
          lawyer or a legal expert.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lawyer is an independent legal professional who advises, represents,
          and defends their clients. A legal expert is an employed legal
          professional who practices in a company. A legal expert who is not a
          lawyer cannot provide independent legal advice.
        </p>
        <p>Here are the key points:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Lawyer:</strong>

                Missions: strategic advice, drafting of documents and monopoly
                of representation before the courts
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Expert:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">

                Missions: risk analysis, regulatory monitoring, contract

          Concretely, if you do not have a legal expert internally, you must
          necessarily call on a lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lawyer can also intervene in addition to a legal expert when the
          company experiences a specific legal problem or if litigation is
          emerging.
