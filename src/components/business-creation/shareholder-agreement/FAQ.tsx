    question: "ðŸ“Œ What is a shareholders' agreement?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>The shareholders' agreement (or <strong>shareholders' agreement</strong> in the case of a joint-stock company) is an extrastatutory legal document. It will specify the partners' respective rights and conduct of business, as well as the composition of the share capital. This document complements the articles of association. The signatories determine the duration of the shareholders' agreement.</p>
        
        <p>The shareholders' agreement is a <strong>contract</strong>. It therefore complies with the legal rules governing contractual relationships. Its scope is limited to the signatories. It is not enforceable against third parties.</p>
        
        <p>Failure to comply with a <strong>shareholders' agreement</strong> may result in the payment of damages by the person who has not respected their commitments.</p>
        
        <p>The <strong>termination of the shareholders' agreement</strong> may occur on the date agreed by the signatories or upon the occurrence of an event foreseen by the shareholders.</p>

    question: "Why draw up a shareholders' agreement?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>The shareholders' agreement is an extra-statutory document that supplements the articles of association. It is optional. Drafting a shareholders' agreement has several advantages:</p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
          <li>
            The shareholders' agreement is <strong>confidential</strong>. Conversely, the articles of association are public and known to all. The information mentioned therein is known only to the signatory shareholders.
          </li>
          <li>
            A shareholders' agreement allows <strong>clauses to be introduced</strong> that could not be contained <strong>in the articles of association</strong>, or simply to benefit from the advantages specific to the agreement: limited duration of commitments made, defined number of shareholders involved, confidentiality, possibility of revision without going through the AGM, establishment of specific obligations, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            The shareholders' agreement is of capital importance in facilitating and clarifying relationship between shareholders, and thereby avoiding and anticipating possible future conflicts.
          </li>

    question: "When should you draw up a shareholders' agreement?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>A shareholders' agreement can be entered into at any time. However, it is best to negotiate it when the company is founded, when relationships between partners are at their best. This will help avoid any potential stalemate later on.</p>
        
        <p>It is possible to draw up a shareholders' agreement when a new shareholder joins the capital. If the new shareholder refuses to sign it, they will be considered a third party. The agreement will be unenforceable against them.</p>

  {
    question: "What form of company requires the drafting of a shareholders' agreement?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>The shareholders' agreement is not limited to any one type of company or size. Deadlocks exist in any type of company, regardless of its nature, and arise in everyday conflicts that do not necessarily represent significant expenditures.</p>
        
        <p>To negotiate and draft a shareholders' agreement adapted to your legal situation, benefit from the support of experts in corporate law.</p>

        <p>Certain clauses may be considered in the negotiation of your shareholders' agreement:</p>
