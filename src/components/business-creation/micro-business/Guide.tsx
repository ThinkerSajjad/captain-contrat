                  A micro-enterprise is an individual business, subject to a <strong>simplified social and tax regime</strong>. This regime applies to entrepreneurs who achieve an annual turnover not exceeding tax below certain ceilings, which vary according to the nature of the activity carried out.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  For 2023, the ceilings are as follows:
                </p>
                
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                  <li>€188,700 for the sale of goods and provision of housing activities;</li>
                  <li>€77,700 for services and liberal professions;</li>
                  <li>€23,000 for the direct or indirect rental of furnished tourist accommodation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                  Micro-entrepreneurs also benefit from <strong>simplified accounting</strong>, as they are not required to submit a balance sheet and simply have to keep a book of receipts. Furthermore, they can opt for a withholding tax on income, under certain conditions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  However, certain activities are excluded from this regime, such as regulated activities (lawyers, doctors, real estate agents, etc.) and legal entities subject to corporate tax (IS).

                  The <strong>4 main advantages</strong> of micro-enterprise are:

                <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Ease of creation:</strong> Launching a micro-business is very simple and quick. The process can be completed within just a few hours, without the need for assistance. All you need to do is fill out a business declaration form and provide some supporting documents (ID, proof of address).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The advantageous tax regime:</strong> micro-enterprises allow for a flat-rate deduction on income, which varies according to the activity: 71% for the sale of goods, 50% for the provision of commercial services, and 34% for liberal activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simplified social security contributions:</strong> social security contributions are calculated on the basis of a fixed rate applied to the turnover actually collected, and not on the profit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simplified accounting:</strong> the micro-entrepreneur is not required to keep complete accounts; he simply has to record his income and issue invoices that comply with legal requirements.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Complete the business start declaration:</strong> You must complete a form, which varies depending on the nature of your business (commercial, craft, or professional).

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Registering your business:</strong> You must register your business for your micro-business, which can be done online on the one-stop shop website. You will need to provide the supporting documents specified when registering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Registering your micro-enterprise:</strong> Depending on your business, you will need to register either with the National Business Register (RNE) or with the Trade and Companies Register (RCS) for a craft activity. Liberal professions may have specific requirements.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Open a bank account:</strong> Although it is not mandatory to open a dedicated bank account if your business income does not exceed €10,000 over two consecutive years, it is strongly recommended for better management of your finances.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Take out insurance:</strong> Depending on your activity, you may be required to take out professional liability insurance, especially if you work in regulated fields.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Apply for ACRE (Aid for Business Creation and Takeover):</strong> If you are eligible, you can apply for ACRE to benefit from a reduction in your social security contributions during the first months of your activity.

                    <strong>Craft activities:</strong> Craft trades are also authorized, such as plumber, electrician, hairdresser, or even food trades (bakery, pastry chef, etc.). It is important to check whether your activity appears on the official list of craft trades.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Liberal activities:</strong> You can engage in unregulated liberal activities, such as consulting, training, translation, or coaching. However, regulated liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, etc.) cannot benefit from micro-entrepreneur status.

                  Starting a micro-business is free in most cases.

Additional costs may apply if you choose to seek legal or accounting assistance, or to take out professional insurance.

                  There is only one mandatory step to create a micro-enterprise: <strong>the declaration of activity</strong>. This must be completed online on the one-stop shop website. To create your micro-enterprise, you will need to complete a form and indicate in particular your personal information (surname, first name, address) and the nature of your activity. Once this declaration has been validated, you will receive your SIRET (business identification) number. This number officially identifies your company and allows you to start your activity.
