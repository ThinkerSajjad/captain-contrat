    question: "ðŸ“Œ How to combine unemployment and micro-enterprise?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>A micro-entrepreneur who starts their own business can continue to receive unemployment benefits. If the micro-business does not generate any income, the entrepreneur continues to receive their unemployment benefits in full.

        <p>No, it is not possible to own two micro-enterprises. However, you can carry out several activities under a single micro-entrepreneur status, dividing them as main and secondary activities. This allows you to group all of your activities under the same tax and social security regime, because the micro-entrepreneur status is attached to the person and not to the activity. However, the activities must be complementary. Please note: the total turnover grouping together all your activities, must not exceed the regulatory ceilings of 188,700â‚¬ for commercial activities and 77,700â‚¬ for the provision of services or liberal.</p>

  {
    question: "Micro-enterprise or SARL: how to choose?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>Here are several questions to ask yourself when choosing between a micro-enterprise and a SARL:</p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Business development:</strong>
            <p>what is your projected turnover? Micro-enterprises are subject to turnover ceilings, and if you anticipate reaching levels of 176,000 euros (for retail), a company may be more suitable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organizational considerations:</strong>
            <p>Do you need to handle complex administrative procedures? Micro-enterprises have simplified accounting and tax obligations, while companies must keep accounts, publish articles of association, publish a legal notice, etc. to correctly starting a micro-enterprise is simpler.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taxation:</strong>
            <p>SARLs are subject to corporate tax, with the option to opt for income tax. Micro-enterprises are taxed on turnover with a flat rate deduction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compensation and social status:</strong>
            <p>How do you want to be paid? In a SARL (limited liability company), the manager receives compensation, which is subject to social security contributions. In a micro-enterprise, the business owner simply withdraws funds from the company's account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business development:</strong>
            <p>Do you have long-term development plans? A SARL allows if your stock company grows to make it easier to bring on partners and raise funds than a micro-enterprise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset protection:</strong>
            <p>A SARL offers better protection of the company's assets, while the micro-enterprise has reduced accounting obligations.</p>

    question: "How to stop a micro-business?",
