    question: "What are the disadvantages of the SAS?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>The 3 disadvantages of the Simplified Joint Stock Company (SAS) are as follows:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Complex drafting of articles of association</strong>: The considerable statutory freedom offered to partners can make drafting articles of association complex. It is necessary to clearly define all the company&apos;s operating rules to avoid differences in interpretation that could lead to conflicts. Moreover, unlike other companies, errors cannot invalidate traditional costs if amendments need to be made later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High social security contributions</strong>: SAS managers, who are considered employees, are subject to higher social security contributions than self-employed workers. This can represent a significant cost for the company, especially if the president or other managers are paid. However, the advantage is that they benefit from the general social security scheme for their contributions, but this also means that they do not benefit from any social security protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inability to access the stock market</strong>: Unlike public limited companies (SA), SASs cannot be listed on the stock market, which limits financing opportunities through the financial markets.

    question: "How to bring a new partner into the airlock?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>To bring a new partner into an SAS, two main methods can be considered: capital increase and share transfer.</p>
        
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Capital increase</strong>: This operation involves creating new shares to integrate the new partner. The incoming partner makes a contribution in cash or in kind in exchange for these new shares. This contribution increases the company&apos;s share capital and requires a collective decision. The company&apos;s articles of association must be amended to reflect the new share capital. A legal notice must be published in a legal announcements journal and the modification must be registered in the register. The capital increase results in a dilution of the shares of existing partners, as the share capital is distributed among a larger number of shares.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share transfer</strong>: This involves the sale by one or more existing partners of their shares to a new partner. This transaction does not require a change to share capital. A share transfer contract must be drawn up specifying the date of the parties, the number of shares transferred and the price. This transfer must be registered in the company&apos;s share transfer register. It is advisable to update the register of beneficial owners to reflect the change in the company&apos;s ownership structure. The transfer of shares in an SAS is free, unless the articles of association provide for an approval or pre-emption clause that limit this freedom.
