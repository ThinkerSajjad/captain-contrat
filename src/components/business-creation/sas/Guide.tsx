                  The simplified joint-stock company (SAS) is a very popular legal form that allows several partners to create a structure adapted to their needs and their business. Indeed, the SAS is renowned for its flexibility, allowing partners to choose a tailor-made operating mode. Partners can, for example, establish one or more general managers to support the president or create a collegiate body to make decisions together. It is this flexibility that makes the SAS the default legal form for start-ups.

                <p>
                  Furthermore, the SAS is a limited liability company, which means that the personal assets of the partners cannot be committed beyond their contributions.

                <p>
                  Finally, the SAS is subject to corporate tax (IS) by default, but the partners benefit from an option for income tax for a maximum period of five years.

                <h4 className="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is the difference between SAS and SASU?</h4>
                
                <p>
                  The main difference between an SAS and a SASU (simplified joint-stock company) lies in the number of partners. A SASU always has a single shareholder. An SAS must be created by at least two people, but the number of partners is not limited.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Drafting the articles of association:</strong> You must draft the articles of association of the SAS, which constitute the foundation of your business. This key legal document can be drafted by yourself or by a lawyer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Deposit of share capital:</strong> The share capital must be deposited in a bank or with a notary to obtain a certificate of deposit of funds. It is mandatory to deposit 50% of the total amount of contributions in cash and 100% of contributions in kind.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Publication of the notice of incorporation:</strong> You must publish a notice of incorporation either in a legal announcements journal (JAL) or in an authorized press service. This can also be done online. This step will inform third parties (people outside the company) of the creation of your business.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Registration application:</strong> You must complete the single form and gather the necessary documents for the registration application. The application must be made online on the One-Stop Shop website. You will receive an acknowledgment of receipt by email. If you choose to go through an online professional, the latter will handle the application for you and the registration formalities will be completed in record time and secure the process.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>

                  Creating an SAS (Simplified Joint Stock Company) has several advantages:
                </p>
                
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flexibility of operation:</strong> the SAS offers great freedom in drafting the statutes, allowing partners to adapt the organizational and decision-making structure to their needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Limited liability:</strong> SAS partners benefit from limited liability based on the amount of their contributions. In the event of financial difficulties, creditors cannot pursue partners for amounts exceeding the amount of their contributions to the share capital, thus protecting their personal assets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Ease of entry for new partners:</strong> The SAS allows for an unlimited number of shareholders, and the terms of entry or exit of new investors are defined in the articles of association. This facilitates fundraising at the integration of new investors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Advantageous social security system for managers:</strong> SAS managers are affiliated with the general social security system, which provides them with social protection similar to that of employees. In addition, they can choose to receive dividends, which are not subject to social security contributions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flexible taxation:</strong> The SAS is subject to corporate tax (IS), but they can also opt for income tax (IR) for five years from accounting year, under certain conditions. This allows partners to choose the most advantageous tax regime for their situation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Easy transfer:</strong> the structure of the SAS allows for a gradual transfer of shares, facilitating the entry of new partners and the transfer of professional activity without having to dissolve the company.
